### Yelp Assignment for iOS Course

*Time Spent*: 10 hours

### User Stories
 * Search results page
   * Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
   * Search bar should be in the navigation bar.
 * Filter page
    * The filters are for: distance, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), and category.
    * The filters table are organized into sections as in the mock.
    * Used the default UISwitch for on/off states.

### Incomplete Stories
  * Radius filter expands as in the real Yelp app but could not get check-mark working.
  * Could not implement the expansion of the Categories.
